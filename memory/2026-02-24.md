## Work Log

- Created comprehensive game design document: `games/Magnet-Madness/GAME_DESIGN.md`
- Concept: "Magnet Madness" - a horror-comedy puzzle game with hands-off experiment design
- Core premise revised: Player as invisible experiment designer sets up magnetic courses, then watches autonomous Bleep navigate (~30s). Scientist reacts via portrait overlay.
- Key mechanics:
  - Setup phase: Place magnetic objects, select Bleep material
  - Watch phase: Bleep runs autonomously with glitches; scientist commentary
  - Emergency stop (once per run) to abort and prevent damage
  - Damage system: Bleep returns visibly damaged on hard failures
  - Scientist portrait with expressions (Doom-style) and catchphrases
- Tone: Comedy-focused with light horror atmosphere; emphasis on slapstick failure
- Estimated 6-8 hours playtime (70-100 puzzles), targeted for PC with Godot
- Unique: "Design then watch" tension, emergency stop, reactive narrator

## Notes
- Mr. Anderson provided extensive feedback refining the paradigm:
  - Player is invisible hand, not character
  - Scientist appears only in transitions and as portrait overlay during runs
  - Hand-off confirmed for experiment execution
  - Run duration: ~30 seconds
  - Failure: Bleep returns damaged (unbalanced, creaking, spitting screws)
  - Emergency kill switch: one intervention per run to avoid damage
  - Scientist expressions: astonishment, surprise, laughter, covering eyes, embarrassment
  - Scientist commentary: humorous catchphrases and explanations during run
- Design doc updated accordingly (v2)
- Next step: prototype core physics/magnetism, Bleep AI, glitch system
