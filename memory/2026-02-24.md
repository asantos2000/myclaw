## Work Log

- Created comprehensive game design document: `games/Magnet-Madness/GAME_DESIGN.md`
- Concept: "Magnet Madness" - a horror-comedy adventure game
- Core premise: Naive scientist protagonist with magnet-manipulation gauntlet, accompanied by glitchy robot assistant Bleep
- Key mechanics:
  - Environmental magnetism manipulation (attract/repel)
  - Robot customization with material properties affecting magnetism susceptibility
  - Glitch system where strong magnetic fields cause Bleep to behave erratically
  - Material-swapping puzzle strategy
- Tone: Comedy-focused with light horror atmosphere (Portal meets Monkey Island)
- Estimated 8-12 hours playtime, targeted for PC
- Unique selling points: glitching companion mechanic, material-based puzzle solving

## Notes
- Mr. Anderson requested game concept pitch on 2026-02-24
- Concept well-received, documented in detail
- Next step: prototype core physics/magnetism mechanics
