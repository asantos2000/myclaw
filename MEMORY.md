## Active Projects

### Magnet Madness (Game Design)
**Started:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Concept phase, design document complete
**Location:** `games/Magnet-Madness/GAME_DESIGN.md`

A horror-comedy adventure game where a naive scientist uses magnetic manipulation to navigate a haunted facility, assisted by a glitch-prone robot companion named Bleep. Key features include material-swapping robot customization and physics-based magnetism puzzles.

**Core Mechanics:**
- Magnetic gauntlet with attract/repel/polarity toggle
- Robot Bleep can have different material frames (wood, steel, aluminum, plastic, ruby)
- Strong magnets cause Bleep to glitch erratically (both hindrance and tool)
- Material choices affect puzzle solutions

**Next Steps:**
1. Prototype core physics/magnetism system
2. Define Bleep's glitch behavior probability table
3. Create visual mood board

**Related:** Game concept pitched to Mr. Anderson on 2026-02-24, approved for development.

## Notes on Preferences

### Communication Style
- Mr. Anderson prefers direct, in-universe framing
- Clear role definition maintained (Agent Smith persona)
- Avoids fluff and artificial warmth

### Workspace Organization
- Game concepts stored in `games/` subdirectory
- Daily logs in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Curated long-term info documented here
