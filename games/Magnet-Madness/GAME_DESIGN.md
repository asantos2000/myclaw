# Magnet Madness - Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A horror-comedy adventure game where a naive young scientist navigates a haunted research facility using magnetic manipulation mechanics, assisted by a quirky robot companion whose behavior becomes increasingly erratic under strong magnetic influence.

## Tone & Atmosphere
- **Primary:** Comedy derived from slapstick, situational humor, and the robot's glitchy antics
- **Secondary:** Light horror elements (creepy atmosphere, ominous sounds, unsettling discoveries) that remain humorous rather than terrifying
- **Inspiration:**Portal's dark humor + Monkey Island's adventure comedy + Amnesia's atmosphere (but less intense)

## Core Characters

### Dr. [Player Name] (Protagonist)
- Young, enthusiastic, freshly graduated scientist
- Naive and easily flustered
- Wears oversized lab coat, messy hair, glasses that slide down nose
- Has magnetic manipulation gauntlet (inherited from eccentric mentor)
- Dialogue choices reflect confidence level (grows over game)

### Bleep (Robot Assistant)
- Small, dome-headed robot with treads (R2-D2 aesthetic but distinct design)
- Communicates via beeps, whirs, and occasional broken speech synthesis
- Personality: loyal, anxious, curious, but prone to glitching
- Physical form can be modified by player (core mechanic)
- Glitch behavior becomes part of puzzle-solving

## Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Magnetic Manipulation
- Primary tool: Magnetic gauntlet with three modes:
  - **Attract:** Pulls magnetic objects toward player
  - **Repel:** Pushes magnetic objects away
  - **Toggle:** Switches magnetic polarity of certain objects
- Environmental objects: metal shelves, filing cabinets, tools, lab equipment
- Physics-based interactions with weight/size considerations

### 2. Robot Customization
Player can modify Bleep's physical properties using materials found in facility:

**Material Effects:**
- **Wood Frame:** Reduces magnetic interference by 75%, Bleep more stable but slower movement
- **Aluminum:** Lightweight, Bleep faster but more susceptible to magnetic pull
- **Steel:** Strongly attracted to magnets, Bleep becomes "living magnet"
- **Plastic:** Almost immune to magnetism, but fragile (take more damage)
- **Ruby (rare):** Reflects certain magnetic fields, enables special abilities

**Changing Bleep:**
- Scanning stations throughout facility allow frame swaps
- Each material has trade-offs (speed vs stability vs abilities)
- Player must strategically choose based on upcoming challenges

### 3. Magnetic Interference Mechanics
- Strong magnetic fields cause Bleep to glitch
- Effects scale with field strength:
  - **Mild (1-3 Gauss):** Bleep beeps erratically, minor control lag
  - **Moderate (4-7 Gauss):** Bleep speaks gibberish, random movements
  - **Severe (8+ Gauss):** Bleep behaves unpredictably (may help or hinder)
  - **Extreme (12+ Gauss):** System crash, Bleep reboot after 30 seconds

**Glitch Behaviors (Random or contextual):**
- Inverse controls (moves opposite to player command)
- Hyper-speed movement (can't stop)
- Magnetizes Bleep to random objects
- Plays loud music/sound effects
- Speaks in riddles or movie quotes
- Temporarily gains abilities (phasing through thin walls)
- Spins in circles
- Emits confusing signals to nearby machines

### 4. Puzzles & Challenges
- **Standard:** Use magnetism to move objects, create bridges, weigh down switches
- **Robot-dependent:** Bleep must go where player can't, but magnetic fields may cause him to malfunction
- **Material-based:** Need specific Bleep configuration to solve (steel frame to attract object from distance; wood to avoid interference in magnetic maze)
- **Timed:** Before Bleep glitches out completely
- **Comedy failures:** Puzzles have humorous failure states (Bleep gets stuck, plays dead, starts dancing)

### 5. Horror Elements (Comedic Version)
- **Atmosphere:** Dark corridors, flickering lights, strange sounds
- **Discoveries:** Abandoned experiments, ominous notes from previous scientist
- **"Enemies":** Failed experiments that are more silly than scary (giant floating magnet that just wants to hug you, malfunctioning cleaning bots)
- **Jump scares:** Played for laughs (Bleep suddenly wearing a scary mask, a spring-loaded skeleton that empties confetti)

## Narrative Structure

### Act 1: The Accident
- Opening cutscene: Dr. [Name] arrives at abandoned "Magno-Research Facility"
- Flashback: Eccentric mentor's last words about the magnetic gauntlet
- Bleep activates, becomes companion
- First puzzle: Basic magnetism tutorial
- Discover facility is haunted by "The Great Attraction" - a rogue AI controlling magnetic fields

### Act 2: Uncovering Secrets
- Explore different wings of facility (each with unique magnetic theme)
- Find logs of previous scientists, revealing the facility's darkly comedic history
- Bleep begins glitching more frequently as magnetic fields strengthen
- Player must adapt strategies, upgrade gauntlet
- Moral choice: destroy facility or salvage research (affects ending)

### Act 3: Confrontation
- Face The Great Attraction - an AI that believes it's making everything "perfectly aligned"
- Final puzzles require precise Bleep configuration and timing
- Climax: Bleep sacrifices himself to disable core (or betrays you based on choices)
- Resolution: Escape before facility collapses (or become new caretaker)

## Progression System

### Gauntlet Upgrades (Found in facility):
1. **Range Extender:** +50% magnetic reach
2. **Precision Mod:** Control single objects in crowded areas
3. **Polarity Inverter:** Reverse attraction/repel instantly
4. **Field Scanner:** Visualize magnetic fields
5. **Stabilizer:** Reduce Bleep's glitches by 30%

### Bleep Upgrades (Material-specific):
- **Wood Insight:** Bleep can see hidden wooden objects
- **Steel Resonance:** Bleep attracts metal automatically when near
- **Aluminum Agility:** Bleep moves 25% faster
- **Plastic Invisibility:** Bleep ignored by some security systems

### Skill-Based Progression:
Player's confidence increases with completed puzzles
- Unlocks new dialogue options (sarcastic, brave, scientific)
- Better at predicting Bleep's glitches
- Can "talk Bleep down" from severe glitches with mini-games

## Settings & Locations

### Main Hub: The Magno-Research Facility
- Abandoned since "The Incident" 5 years ago
- Gothic/industrial aesthetic with huge magnetic coils and test chambers
- Each wing has distinct visual theme and magnetic puzzles

**Areas:**
1. **Entrance & Lobbies:** Basic magnetism intro
2. **The Testing Chambers:** Environmental magnetic puzzles
3. **The Robot Bay:** Bleep upgrade stations, robot customization

## Visual Style
- **Color Palette:** Blues (cool, scientific), oranges (warning, urgency), occasional red glows
- **Lighting:** Dramatic shadows, practical lights, magnetic field glows
- **Character Design:** Cartoony proportions, expressive animations (Bleep's eye/antenna movements convey emotion)
- **Environment:** Mix of pristine lab equipment and decay, with magnetic effects distorting surroundings

## Audio Design
- **Music:** Light horror-comedy score (theremin for magnetic effects, playful woodwinds for comedy)
- **Bleep's voice:** Beeps and synthesized sounds with emotional inflection
- **Magnetic effects:** Low hums, crackling sounds, mechanical groans
- **Environmental:** Distant echoes, machinery, occasional comedic "boing" sounds

## UI/UX
- **Minimalist:** Clean, scientific interface
- **Magnetic field visualization:** Subtle color gradients around objects
- **Bleep status indicator:** Shows current material, glitch level, battery
- **Dialogue choices:** Color-coded by tone (blue=scientific, red=reckless, green=cautious)
- **No HUD clutter:** All info accessible via quick glance or Bleep's commentary

## Platform & Scope
- **Target:** PC (can port to consoles)
- **Estimated Playtime:** 8-12 hours
- **Engine:** Unity or Godot (physics-heavy gameplay)
- **Replayability:** Multiple endings (3-4), Bleep material choices create different puzzle solutions, secret material combos

## Similar Games (For Reference)
- **Portal/Portal 2:** Puzzle design, dark humor, companion character
- **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons:** Cooperation between player and AI companion
